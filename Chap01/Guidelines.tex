%Formatting Guidelines for Writing Dissertation.
\chapter{Introduction}\label{Guidelines}
A treatise advancing a new point of view resulting from research is one of the compulsory requirements of an academic degree of NIT Rourkela. Undergraduate\index{undergraduate} students submit a project report in support of their candidature for B.Tech. degree. Similarly, Masters\index{masters} students submit theses, and doctoral\index{doctoral} students submit dissertations. Unless otherwise stated explicitly, henceforth in this document the word ``dissertation'' will be used as a synonym for ``report'' and ``thesis''. 
\par This document is intended to provide a guideline to students in the preparation of their dissertations. A dissertation is expected to have ethical standards and uniform format with readability. NITR will accept dissertation only in pdf format, which should be uploaded directly to the NITR dissertation submission web page for approval by supervisor. Templates\index{template} to assist in formatting\index{formatting} dissertation in \LaTeX~ is available in \texttt{Academic -> Dissertation Template} at the URL \texttt{http://nitris.nitrkl.ac.in}.

\end{figure}

\item [e.] \textbf{Spacing}\index{spacing}\\
The dissertation should be 1.5-spaced. However, Table of Contents, footnotes, graphs, tables, appendices, list of figures, list of tables, list of algorithms, references, bibliography, and index should be written in single space. Two consecutive paragraphs should be separated by double line spacing.
\item [f.] \textbf{Font}\index{font}\\
The entire dissertation must be written using only a single font including all the texts inside graphs, figures, block diagrams, \textit{etc}. While writing captions of tables and figures, the font size should be decreased by one point. Similarly, the font size of bibliography and index should also be lessened by a point. Students are advised to use the following in the body text~\textemdash
\begin{itemize}
\item[] serif fonts like Times New Roman (TNR) of size 12pt \\
or \\
\textsf{sans-serif fonts like Arial of size 11pt}. 
\end{itemize}
Needless to say that the use of font should be uniform throughout. Headings, Titles \textit{etc.} should use fonts as given below in Table~\ref{tab-fonts}.

\end{tabular}
\label{tab-fonts}
\end{table}
}
\item [g.] \textbf{Table and Figure}\index{table}\index{figure}\\
All tables, figures, and other such illustrations referenced in the text should be numbered for unique identification. The number format should be $p.q$ with $p$ signifying the chapter number where the illustration appears and $q$ denoting the serial number of that illustration in the chapter $p$. The serial number should be set to 1 at the beginning of a new chapter. A table caption should be placed at the top of the table, and a figure caption should be placed at the bottom of the figure. The caption should follow the unique number $p.q$. The size of the font in the caption of tables and figures should be one less than the text font size. 
\item [h.] \textbf{References}\index{reference}\\
``References'' should be treated as the last chapter and placed at the end of the dissertation. It should not be numbered like other chapters. Texts within the references should have single spacing. The size of the font may be reduced by a point or two. Journal article~\citep{Shannon,Lowe}, Patent~\citep{BulbE,ViBEpatent}, book~\citep{p00e,Vapnik}, conference article~\citep{Toyama,icra}, online resource~\citep{nasa,Kodak}, Ph.D. dissertation~\citep{Sutherland,Dhawan} are usually referred in the text. Some samples of various bibliographic styles are included in this guideline for illustration. You are advised to follow one reference format of any dominant journal of your field.
\end{itemize}

\section{Chapters}\index{chapter}
In the text of the dissertation, each chapter should begin on a fresh page. They should also be designated in the Table of Contents along with other major sections of each chapter. The page numbers listed on the Table of Contents must correlate with the beginning of each section or chapter. All texts should be written with 1.5-spacing. Each chapter should begin with a chapter number in Arabic numerals (font size: Times New Roman 17 points or Arial 16 points, Bold) followed by the chapter title in bold face of size 24 points in Times New Roman font or 22 points in Arial font. %It is preferred to begin a chapter without any section name or number. continuing for a maximum of two paragraphs preferably accommodated within half a page.
\par The first level section should have number of format $a.b$, where the number $a$ is an Arabic number denoting the chapter number and $b$ is also an Arabic number starting from 1 and counting up for each section. For example 3.1, 4.2, or 1.5, \textit{etc}. The section title should follow the section number. Both the title and number should be in the bold face of size 17 points in Times New Roman font or 16 points in Arial font.
\par The second level section should have number of format $a.b.c$, where $c$ is an Arabic number. For example 3.1.1, 4.2.1, or 1.5.2 \textit{etc}. The sub-section title in bold letters should follow the number in bold. The font size should be 14 points Times New Roman or 13 points Arial. Except when it is commonly followed in your field, it is suggested not to give serial number beyond $a.b$ stage, \textit{i.e.} serializing like $a.b.c$ is discouraged.
\par The third level section should have no number. The sub-sub-section title should be in bold letters. The font size should be 12 points Times New Roman or 11 points Arial.
